# **Zero-Shot Sentiment Analysis on Airline Tweets**  

This project demonstrates **Zero-Shot Text Classification** using **Transformers** to perform **Sentiment Analysis** on airline-related tweets without the need for task-specific training data.

---

##  **Key Features**  
- Utilizes **Hugging Face Transformers** for Zero-Shot Classification.  
- Analyzes sentiment (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral) of airline tweets.  
- Handles real-world text data efficiently.
